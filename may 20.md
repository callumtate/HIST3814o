# Blog post for the week ending May 20

This week the material that the course covered this week disscused the interesting possibilities that the increase in the use of digtal tools in the humanities. The readings covered the use of the digital tools such as blogs and public facing annotations in tools such as hypothosis and the advantages and the problems that can be found in allowing work to be produced and accesible in such a way. Especially interesting was the article regarding the problems that [one author](http://www.lotfortynine.org/2017/06/my-digital-publishing-update-nothing/) had encountered in trying to get work that they had published online before attempting to get it printed in paper, this delivered an interesting perspective on the resitances that can be encountered by someone attempting to push the boat out with a new idea and methods of incorporating digital tools into your work. The readings also showed the interesting ways that organisations such as the canadian government have on helping grow the use of digital tools and public facing research and work to enhance and or complement the work that is already being carried out. This acceptance of tools by large organisations such as the Canadian Government will certainly help to encourage the acceptance of these tools and there uses.
