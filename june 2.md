#blog post for week 3

this week the readings talked more on the technical advantages and issues that ocr and the use of algorithims propose to the mass research and sifting of data in research projects. the readings also touched on the issues that bad copies of digitized material can lead to in such mass organization attempts.  The excersises this week in manipulating the data of the texan republics correspondece showed that as even with the well used and reviewed copy on archive.org it still found issues and garbled text in the work throughs in the dhbox leading to some names and dates being mangled into gibberish this also can be seen even further when we had to cluster the text by names and there were examples of where the ocr had misread letters into names leading to examples of the name appearing several different times in slightly different ways. The readings this week also show how given more time and practice in the machince learning abilities of advanced OCR technology and better digitization efforts of text into forms available for OCR then the amount of data that can be processed by a single researcher will continue to grow allowing single researchers to do the work that once would have taken teams or great periods of time
