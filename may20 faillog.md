# Failog for the week ending May 20th 

Due to previous classses and there needs for work in markdown and github for uses very similar to the request that we had to this week the majority of the work went by relativley simply. However I did still have some issues with the command line in the dhbox. 

I also was able to correct one major issue I had last week with misinterpreting the requirments that were needed for the weekly blog posts and thus was able to get  one completed this week 

This week in issues more relevant to the current time, the use of the comand line to install programs and run actual commands is something that I as I am sure many other students in the class have very limited experience in actually using due to the generally extremly limted need for them in modern operating systems. This led to many simple issues appearing as result of this making what initially seemed like a relativley simple task in the outline for this module became a greater piece of work than it seemed it would be. 

 A third issue that I encountered in the work this week is that work in markdown files and editors and in github and the command line is the lack of spelling and grammer checkers built in as you would find in a program such as Microsoft Word, mean that many of the simple tasks such as autocapitalization are missing and that means that an additional look is needed over my work so as to try and reduce and mistakes slipping through that would normally be caught by autocorrect and spellcheckers.
