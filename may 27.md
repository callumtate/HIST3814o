# Blog post for week 1 

this week the readings covered the idea of crowdsourcing the leg work for annotating document and transcribing them into digital text. Which are then able to be digitally published. the project given in the articles is very different than other eexamples that Ive seen of this type as work, such as the project being completed by the Canadian government on catologing the records made during the 1919 spanish flu. though that project has very different goals and timeframes. one very interesting aspect of the project was the very short time frame that the project had as it seemed the entire project took place over only 4-5 months while it seems like the project would have benifited for a long period and so it would be interesting to see how the transcription work continued after the project compared to the stats that they had at the end of the project.  it also would be interesting to see if any steps where taken against people causing issues, the project did say they were suprised as to the results but also mention that they removed several accounts. overall though the project presented some interesting looks into the innerworkings of a public crowdsourcing activity.
